#### Brief
A simple language parser implemented in go designed to parse source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The parser is built using Pratt parsing approach.
- The parser can be used to parse source code into an AST. The AST can then be used for various purposes such as code analysis, optimization, or generation.
- Handles prefix and infix operators.
- Uses a binding power approach to handle operator precedence

#### Local Setup
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KumaarBalbir/go-parser.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd go-parser`
- Build the parser: `go build -o <your-exe-parser-name> ./src`
- Run the parser: `./<your-exe-parser-name>`
